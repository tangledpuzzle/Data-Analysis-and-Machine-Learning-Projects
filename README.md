# Randy Olson's data analysis and machine learning projects

This is a repository of code and data for my data analysis and machine learning projects.

Each repository will (usually) correspond to one of the blog posts on my web site, http://www.randalolson.com/blog/

Be sure to check the documentation (usually in IPython Notebook format) in the directory you're interested in for the notes on the analysis, code license, data usage terms, etc.

If you don't have the necessary software installed to run IPython Notebook, don't fret. You can use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) to view a notebook on the web.

For example, if you want to view the notebook in the `wheres-waldo-path-optimization` directory, copy the [full link](https://github.com/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/wheres-waldo-path-optimization/Where's%20Waldo%20path%20optimization.ipynb) to the notebook then copy it into [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/wheres-waldo-path-optimization/Where%27s%20Waldo%20path%20optimization.ipynb).
